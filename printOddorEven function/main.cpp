/*Write a function named printOddorEven that accepts an integer and returns nothing.
Your function should print if the parameter specified is odd or even.

Example
When printOddorEven(10) is called the following will be the output
Number 10 is even
When printOddorEven(15) is called the following will be the output
Number 15 is odd
Note:
 You must write a function prototype
 You must call the function from main
 You need to implement the function under main

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void printOddorEven(int);

int main()
{
    int n;
    
    cout<<"Print Odd or Even\n";
    
    cout<<"Enter number: ";
    cin>>n;
    
    printOddorEven(n);
    

    return 0;
}

void printOddorEven(int number)
{
    if(number%2==0)
    cout<<"Number "<<number<<" is even.";
    else
    cout<<"Number "<<number<<" is odd.";
